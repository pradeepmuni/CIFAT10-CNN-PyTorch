# CIFAT10-CNN-PyTorch
CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.


In this classification, we aim to correctly identify the object from a dataset of tens of thousands of images by using the Convolutional Neural Network(PyTorch)

There are 10 categories an image may fall under:
0. airplane
1. automobile
2. bird
3. cat
4. deer
5. dog
6. frog
7. horse
8. ship
9. truck
